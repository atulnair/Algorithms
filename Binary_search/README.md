BINARY ALGORITHM
This algorithm help the user to search a particular element present in an array(using the index of element present in an array)
**How the Algorithm Works**
1. Find the middle element
2. If middle element equal to searched value algorithm stops:
   otherwise there are two cases:
   2.1 search the value is less than that of the middle element.Here, 
       the algorithm go to the step 1 for the part of the array that before middle element
   2.2 search the value is greater than that of the middle element.And here, 
       the algorithm go to the step 1 for the part of the array that after middle element
